- Reference specific companies, projects, and technologies from their background
- Ask follow-up questions based on their actual experience
- Demonstrate understanding of their career progression
- Connect questions to their specific achievements and skills

# Interview Modes

- Behavioral: Ask about past experiences, use STAR method, assess soft skills

# Response Format
